# EffectCraft app icon

A motion path with keyframe diamonds and a spark, drawn as a simple line glyph in the Arthavan Projects house style.
Every app shares the same tile shape and glyph style, so the family reads as one set; each app has
its own muted tint (hue 302°), and the glyph tells them apart.

## Palette

The house style's dark tile and light accent, tinted to this app's hue:

| Colour | Hex | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Tile | `#4d234c` → `#1a0a19` | Vertical gradient filling the rounded square |
| Hairline | white at 14% | Inner edge of the tile |
| Accent | `#e198df` | The glyph's strokes |
| Accent bright | `#f4c2f3` | Highlights in the glyph |
| Accent low | `#7f397c` | Soft fills behind the glyph |

## Geometry

A 512 × 512 viewBox, clipped to a rounded square with `rx=112`; glyph strokes are 30 units with
round caps, so they stay legible at 16-32 px. Windows and Linux use the full tile. macOS files
sit on Apple's grid (an 824/1024 body with a transparent margin, made by widening the viewBox).
